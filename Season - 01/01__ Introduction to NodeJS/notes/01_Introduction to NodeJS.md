# Chapter 1 : Introduction to Node.js

## Q. What is Node.js ?

1. Node.js is a Javascript runtime environment built on Chrome's V8 Javascript Engine.  
2. Node.js made possible for developers to use Javascript to write:  
   a) command line tools  
   b) server side scripting.  
3. It made possible to use only one language i.e. Javascript for server as well  
   as client side programming thus unifying web application development around a single programming language.  
4. Node made possible to run and execute code outside a web browser.  
5. Node.js has an event-driven architecture capable of asynchronous I/O (Non-Blocking I/O).(🔴 :: This very property makes Node.js way popular.)


> ⚠️ **Note:**  
> Wherever there is Javascript is in use there should be a Javascript Engine for running the JS Code.


## History of Node.js

### Chapter 01 : 2009
- Ryan Dahl(creator of Node.js)
- starts developing a project to run Javascript outside the web browsers.
- He started developing his JS runtime using the SpiderMonkey JavaScript engine (Firefox’s JavaScript engine).
- After few weeks he switched to Google’s V8 JavaScript engine (Chrome’s JavaScript engine) because of its better performance.

### Chapter 02 : Entry of Joyent(IT & Services Company) 
  - Joyent(IT & Services Company) sponsored Ryan Dahl's project and hired him to work full-time on Node.js.

  - Before Node.js name was web.js until Dahl realises it can be used for more than just web servers.He renamed it to Node.js.

  - In Nov 2009, Ryan Dahl officially announced the first version of Node.js (v0.1.14).

  - In Dec 2009, NPM (Node Package Manager) was introduced as a package manager for Node.js.

### Chapter 03 : Growth and Adoption

  - Before 2011 , Node.js has only MacOS and Linux support.

  - In 2011, Joyent and Microsoft collaborated to bring Node.js to Windows.

  - Over the next few years, Node.js gained popularity among developers for its non-blocking I/O model and scalability.

  - Major companies like Netflix, LinkedIn, and Walmart adopted Node.js for their backend services.

  - The Node.js Foundation was established in 2015 to oversee the development and growth of Node.js.

### Chapter 04 : Ryan Dahl steps down

  - In 2012, Ryan Dahl stepped down as the lead maintainer of Node.js, passing the reins to other developers in the community.

  - He later went on to create Deno, a new runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript.

### Chapter 05 : Division and Merger
  
  - In 2014, a group of developers created io.js, a fork of Node.js, due to disagreements over the project's governance.

  - In 2015, the Node.js Foundation was established to bring together the Node.js and io.js communities.

  - In 2016, io.js merged back into Node.js, and the project continued under the Node.js Foundation.

### Chapter 06 : Merge of Node.js Foundation with JS Foundation

  - In 2019, the Node.js Foundation merged with the JS Foundation to form the OpenJS Foundation, which now oversees the development of Node.js and other JavaScript projects.

### Chapter 07 : Present Day
  - As of 2025, Node.js continues to be a popular choice for server-side development, with a large and active community contributing to its growth and evolution.
